<h1>Python Mandelbrot Renderer</h1>
<h2>What/Why</h2>
<p>[What is the project and why did I decide to create it]</p>

<h2>Code & Results</h2>
<p>I made a multiple iterations of this programme. One for each RGB channel in case you wanted images in just red (as seen in this site's icon), green, blue or white. There is also an "RGB" version which combines the three primary colours together creating images with a wider spectrum of colours. I also made an "animate" version which allows animations to be created.</p>


<h3>"Image Generation"</h3>

<p><a href="MandelbrotResources/MandelbrotRGB.py">This</a> is the code for the RGB version of the programme which uses the "tkinter" library for drawing to the screen, "pillow" to save the final image, "numpy" to more efficiently handle large multi-dimensional arrays, and "numba" for running code on the GPU (nvidia graphics card with CUDA support required).</p>
<p>The following images show photos generated by the</p>

<li>Red</li>
<li>RGB</li>

</ol>
<p>versions respectively.</p>

<p>The programme provides the user with on screen controls to zoom and navigate.</p>

<p>The arrow key buttons pan the camera, the plus and minus zoom in and out respectively, and the "set" button sets the number of iterations to be that entered in the textbox, more iterations gives an image with more detail (so can zoom in more) but it takes longer to render the image.


<h3>Video Generation</h3>
<p>I also created a verion which allows videos/gifs to be generated. The code needs to be changed to allow faster/slower zooming or zooming in to a different location.</p>
<p>If I ever returned to this project (or more likely re-made it entirely in a faster language like C++) I would make this more user friendly. Regardless, here are some example videos produced.</p>
