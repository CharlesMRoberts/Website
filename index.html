<h1>Welcome To My Website!</h1>

<h2>What is this website for?</h2>
<p>[INSERT EXPLANATION HERE!]</p>

<h2>My Projects </h2>
<ul>



<li> <a href="Mandelbrot.html"> Mandelbrot Renderer in Python </a> </li>
<p>A project I created which produces images and videos representing the mandelbrot set, a set of complex numbers with a long-winded definition.</p>


<li><a href="Documents/MathDoc.pdf">Mathematical Documentation</a></li>
<p>A word document I created in 2023 which was supposed to expand upon my EPQ (see below) as there were many topics which I did not have time to discuss in there (due to the word/page limit)</p>


<li> <a href="Documents/Fourier.pdf"> Attempt at LaTeX (Fourier Series) </a> </li>
<p>I was introduced to a tool which mathematicians and scientists use to create nice looking articles & papers. I gave it a go myself, choosing to create write about fourier series. The purpose was more so to learn LaTeX than to learn about Fourier Series (also I was in year 12) so I cannot garuntee the mathematical accuracy of my statements, but I think it is a good overview.</p>


<li><a href="Documents/EPQ.pdf">Extended Project Qualification (EPQ)</a></li>
<p>A project I completed for a qualification, about mathematics and its history (very briefly).</p>


<li><a href="Documents/ComputerScienceProject.pdf"> A Level Computer Science Programming Project </a></li>
<p>A project in which I created a 3d physics engine from scratch (using only some basic libraries). All physics and 3d rendering was implemented by myself. This project also includes videos, found <a href="Documents/CSVideos">here</a>.</p>
